# Welcome to Delhi!

As the first stop on your journey to our wedding celebration, Delhi, the capital city of India, offers a vibrant tapestry of culture, history, and modernity. This page is designed to give you a brief overview and helpful tips for navigating and enjoying your time in Delhi.

## Getting to Know Delhi

Delhi is a city that bridges two different worlds. Old Delhi, once the capital of Islamic India, contrasts with the imperial city of New Delhi, created by the British Raj. Together, they form a city full of fascinating sites and experiences.

## Arrival Tips

### Airport Information
You'll be landing at Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL), one of the largest and busiest airports in India. Upon arrival, you'll find various options for reaching the city center, including taxis, app-based ride services, and the Delhi Metro.

### Currency Exchange
It's advisable to exchange some currency to Indian Rupees (INR) at the airport for immediate expenses. ATMs are also widely available throughout the city.

### Transportation
- **Metro**: The Delhi Metro is a convenient, efficient way to travel around the city. It connects the airport, New Delhi, and many major tourist spots.
- **Taxis and Ride-Shares**: Prepaid taxis and ride-sharing apps like Uber and Ola are safe and commonly used methods for getting around.

## What to Do in Delhi

Delhi is rich in cultural, historical, and architectural landmarks. If you have some time to explore, here are a few must-visit places:

- **Lotus Temple**: Known for its flowerlike shape, this Bahá'í House of Worship is open to all, regardless of religion.
- **Chandni Chowk**: One of the oldest and busiest markets in Old Delhi, perfect for experiencing the city's culinary delights and shopping.

## Safety and Etiquette

- **Stay Hydrated**: Delhi can be quite warm, especially from April to July. Always carry bottled water with you.
