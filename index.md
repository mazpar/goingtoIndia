 Hi, I am Parichay Mazumdar;
 a Pre Doctoral Researcher at Max-Planck Institute for Radioastronomy, Bonn, Germany. I'm currently working in sub-millimeter astronomy.
 My research focuses on the functioning of Giant Molecular Clouds (aka GMC, stellar nurseries); in particular understanding the role of 
 feedback from giant OB stars on their parent GMC. For this I have extensively studied one of the brightest stellar nurseries in our
 Galaxy called G305 using the APEX Telescope at Chile. Here's a really cool picture I made of the G305 region.
