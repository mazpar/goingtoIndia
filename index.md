Hello dear friends and family,

As we inch closer to our special days from November 17th to 19th, we are thrilled to share more about your upcoming journey to India, where we'll celebrate our union surrounded by those we cherish. This page will be your primary source for all the details you need for a comfortable and memorable stay.

## Travel and Accommodation

### Arrival in India
We recommend arriving at Delhi at least 3 days before the wedding to get acclimatized to the country. For the wedding itself you need to arrive at **Raipur Airport** on **November 16th**. From there, transportation will be arranged to take you to our wedding location.

### Accommodation
Accommodations have been arranged at the wedding venue itself between 16-11 and 20-11-2024. All wedding related events will also take place at the same location.

### What to Pack
- **Dress for Celebration**: Pack outfits for multiple wedding events, considering the elegance and tradition of Indian weddings. Comfortable yet festive attire will ensure you enjoy each moment to its fullest. If you want to shop outfits for the wedding, go to [Delhi - Tips and Tricks](https://mazpar.github.io/goingtoIndia/delhi/) page to check out recommendations.
- **Essentials**: Remember to bring personal medications, travel adaptors for India (types C, D, and M), and any other essentials for international travel.

## Stay Updated
This page will be your go-to for any updates leading up to the wedding, including any changes to the schedule, tips for your stay, and insights into the local area.

For any immediate questions or additional information, please feel free to contact us directly at [Our wedding email address](mailto:imke_parichay@protonmail.com).

We are beyond excited to have you with us in India, sharing in the joy and love of our special days. See you soon!
