### ⚠️ SAFETY RELATED INFORMATION ⚠️
We understand that some travelers might have concerns about their journey to the wedding destination via Raipur in Chhattisgarh, India. [While Dutch and several other European embassies have categorized the entire state as a moderate risk zone](https://www.nederlandwereldwijd.nl/reisadvies/india), it’s essential to recognize that such advisories try to stay on the side of caution.

It's crucial to note that [the specific destination and the route to the wedding venue are situated outside the risk zones identified by the embassies](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Hotel+Silver+Moon,+Katapali,+A+Katapali,+Odisha,+India/Swami+Vivekananda+Airport,+Raipur,+Atal+Nagar-Nava+Raipur,+Chhattisgarh,+India/@19.7637481,84.3297896,5.54z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a213e7bffffffff:0xd7d5db3fa2811510!2m2!1d83.8999705!2d21.4470801!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a28c38faab9e2bb:0xab7fb2d06ebff7ca!2m2!1d81.7403737!2d21.1860424!3e0?entry=ttu). The South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP), known for its detailed and accurate conflict mapping, [confirms that these areas are currently considered no / extremely low risk](https://www.satp.org/conflict-maps/india-maoistinsurgency).

We want to assure you that we would never extend an invitation to our loved ones without ensuring their safety first. The well-being of our guests is paramount, and every measure has been taken to guarantee a secure and enjoyable visit. We are fully committed to hosting you in a safe environment and wouldn’t consider it otherwise.

### Health and Safety : Vaccinations

Ensure you are up-to-date on routine vaccines. Carry your vaccination certificate with you.
  - _Dutch Travellers_: Contact the GGD or vaccination clinic in your municipality. [The GGD’s website](https://www.ggdreisvaccinaties.nl/faq) tells you which vaccinations are required for which country. Get your vaccinations in time. The GGD, vaccination clinic or, in some cases, your family doctor can vaccinate you. [Visit the LCR’s website to find out where you can get travel vaccinations in your municipality](https://www.lcr.nl/Vaccinatie-adressen). This information is in Dutch.
  - _Non Dutch Travellers_: Please consult the relavant medical authorities or your general practitioner to stay updated on your booster vaccines.

- **Travel-Specific Vaccines**
  - **Hepatitis A:** Recommended due to the potential for contaminated food and water.
  - **Typhoid:** Especially important because of the prevalent risk associated with contaminated food and water in India.
  - **Hepatitis B:** Recommended for those who might be exposed to blood or body fluids, have sexual encounters with new partners, or get medical or dental procedures.
  - **Japanese Encephalitis:** Consider this vaccine if you plan to spend a lot of time outdoors or in rural areas, or if you're going to visit India during the monsoon season.
  - **Rabies:** Recommended for travelers involved in outdoor and other activities that might bring them into direct contact with dogs, bats, and other mammals. This is particularly important if you'll be staying for a long time or will be in remote areas.
  - **Yellow Fever:** Not a risk in India, but the government requires proof of yellow fever vaccination if you are arriving from a country with a risk of yellow fever virus transmission.
  - **COVID-19:** Staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations is advisable, considering the global presence of the virus. Check the latest travel advisories and entry requirements related to COVID-19 before your trip.
&nbsp;

- **Other Vacine Considerations**
  - **Malaria Prophylaxis:** India has a risk of malaria in certain areas. While there's no vaccine for malaria, preventive medication may be recommended, along with measures to avoid mosquito bites.
  - **Traveler’s Diarrhea:** While not a vaccine, travelers may consider carrying a course of antibiotics as a precautionary measure against severe traveler’s diarrhea, following a healthcare provider’s prescription.

### Health and Safety : Oter Considerations

- **Water Safety**: Drink and brush your teeth with only bottled or purified water. Avoid ice cubes and tap water due to the risk of waterborne diseases.
- **Food Safety**: Eat well-cooked meals. Street foods can potentially be comntaminated. A good rule to find tasty and safe street food is to looks for places with many (>10 is a good number) of local residents. You can also try to find guided street food tours but they tend to be expensive by Indian standards. Fruits and vegetables should be washed and peeled.
- **Bug Repellants**: Bring repellents to protect against insect and musquite bites. Mosquitoes are especially a health risk as Malaria, Dengue and Chikungunya are very prevelant in India. You can avoid these by staying away from places with stagnant water nearby, using mosquito repellants all the time.
- **Carry Hand Sanitizer**: Maintain hand hygiene to avoid gastrointestinal upsets.
- **Medications**: Note that medical facilities may vary greatly in quality, especially outside major cities. So make sure to carry all your essential medications with you. Also carry ORS solution in case you encounter traveler's diarrhea.

### Local Customs and Etiquette

- **Dressing Etiquette**: Big cities, especially wealthier and highly educated crowds are very western in their outlook. But if you are visiting religious sites and events, make sure to wear clothing that covers your shoulders and legs. Also wear clothing that covers your shoulders and legs in smaller towns and rural areas.
- **Remove Your Shoes**: Always remove your shoes when entering a place of worship or someone's house. If before entering a place you see a lot of shoes outside, it is a good indicator that you should remove your shoes. If there are lockers for shoes please use them.
- **Greetings**: The traditional Indian greeting is the "Namaste," performed by pressing your palms together near your heart and bowing slightly. However in big cities people are very much accustomed to the western way of living.
- **Eat with Your Right Hand**: The left hand is considered unclean, so use your right hand for eating and passing items whenever possible.
- **Accept Hospitality**: It’s polite to accept tea or snacks if offered by a host, even if you only take a small amount.
- **Mind Your Feet**: Feet are considered impure, so avoid pointing your feet at people or religious icons.
- **Bargaining**: Bargaining is common in markets but do it respectfully.
- **Public Displays of Affection**: Public displays of affection such as kissing may not be well-received.

### Transportation

- **Local Transport**: Flights now connect all major cities and should be the first choice of transport. Trains are usually slow and need bookings well in advance. If you really want to experience trains then you should book _AC 1st class (1A)_ or _AC 2-Tier (2A)_ train tickets only. [Use this official website to find trains and book tickets](https://www.irctc.co.in/nget/train-search).
- **Taxis and Ride-Shares**: Preferably use official taxis or reputable ride-sharing apps like Uber and Ola especially in Delhi.
- **Driving**: Not recommended for tourists due to the challenging road conditions and traffic rules.

### Practical Travel Tips

- **Currency**: The Indian Rupee (INR) is the currency of India. Inform your bank of your travel outside of EU to avoid any issues with card transactions.
- **Electrical Plugs**: India uses 230V, 50Hz electricity, and plug types C, D, and M. Bring a universal adapter.
- **Language**: Hindi is most widely spoken. English is mostly spoken in big cities, in tourist areas amongst the highly educated people.
- **Safety**: Be vigilant in crowded places and avoid traveling alone at night. Scams targeting tourists can be common, so stay cautious and informed.
