# Welcome to a Bengali Wedding: A Guide for Western Guests

Bengali weddings are an elaborate blend of culture, joy, and tradition. As a guest, you're about to experience a series of rituals filled with deep meaning and community spirit. Here's what you can expect:

## Morning Rituals:

- **Dadhi Mangal**: This is a pre-dawn meal involving the families of the bride and groom, featuring curd (yogurt) and sweets, symbolizing a sweet and prosperous beginning.

## Pre-Wedding Rituals:

- **Gaye Holud (Turmeric Ceremony)**: Separate events at the bride and groom's place where turmeric paste is applied to them, symbolizing beauty and purification.
- **Biddhi Puja (Ancestor Worship)**: Following the Gaye Holud, this ritual involves invoking and worshiping the ancestors. A priest or elder family member will conduct prayers, offering flowers, fruits, and sweets to an altar representing the ancestors. This is to seek their blessings for the couple's future, symbolizing the link between the past generations and the new union.

## Main Wedding Ceremony:

- **Bor Jatri and Boron**: The groom starts from his house after receiving his mother’s blessings, in a specially decorated car sent by the bride’s family, towards the wedding venue. He is accompanied by a few of his friends and relatives and this wedding party is known as Bor Jatri. Upon reaching the wedding venue, the wedding party is received with much enthusiasm, amidst blowing of conch shells and ululations. The mother of the bride welcomes the groom with a Baran Dala, a large tray made of cane containing auspicious ingredients like rice, turmeric, betel nuts, bananas and a lighted diya.
- **Saat Paak and Subho Drishti**: The groom is brought into the wedding mandap- known as Chhadnatolla- and an initial puja is performed by the person who will do the Kanya Sampradan. The bride sits on a wooden platform known as Piri and is carried by 4–5 members of her family to the mandap. During this journey, she hides her face from view with the help of a couple of betel leaves. The bride is supposed to circle around the groom seven times, while being carried. This is known as Saat Paak. The bride and groom are then placed in front of each other. The bride removes the betel leaves and the two set their eyes on each other, amidst hooting, and sounds of conch shells and ululations. This is known as Subho Drishti.
- **Mala Badal (Exchange of Garlands)**: The bride and groom exchange floral garlands. A fun element is added when the relatives of both bride and the groom hoist them up to make it difficult to reach.
- **Sampradan (Giving Away the Bride)**: The bride is then brought into the Chhadnatolla, where she is seated opposite the groom. An elderly male member of the bride’s family unites their hands by use of a sacred thread, while the priest chants the customary wedding mantras.
- **Hom**: The bride and the groom then sit beside each other in front of the sacred fire while the priest utters Vedic mantras, which they have to repeat. While doing so, they have to periodically make offerings to the fire.
- **Saptapadi**: The priest ties a knot between the end of the bride’s saree and the groom's shawl. The couple then have to go around the fire seven times, while uttering the seven sacred vows.
- **Lajanjali (Offerings)**: The bride’s brother puts puffed rice into her hands while the groom joins her hands from behind to pour the offerings into the fire together.
- **Sindoor Daan (Vermilion Application)**: The groom applies Sindoor on the parting of the bride’s hair and covers her head with a new saree known as the Lajjabastra.

## Post-Wedding Rituals:

- **Basar Ghar (Couple's Time Together)**: The newlyweds spend time together as the family celebrates into the night with music and dance.
- **Kaal Ratri**: The night after the wedding is done, the couple are not allowed to meet each other and are put up in separate rooms.
- **Bou Bhaat**: The next morning, the bride is officially initiated into the new family during the Bou Bhaat ritual. The husband presents his new wife with clothes and sweets on a platter and promises to take care of her for the rest of their lives. Then she offers the members of the family rice and ghee during mealtime.
- **Reception**: The same evening, the groom’s family invites their relatives for a reception where they get to meet the new bride and offer their best wishes to the couple.

## Wedding Attire

- **The Bengali groom** typically wears a Kurta, which is known as Panjabi, with a Dhoti. While the Panjabi may be made from various materials like cotton, silk or tussar, the Dhoti is generally made of Muslin or a Bengal Handloom known as Tant. The Panjabi features gold or sometimes diamond studded buttons. The groom wears dots of sandalwood paste on his forehead and also dons a conical head adornment known as the ‘Topor’, made of Shola or Indian Cork. He wears a garland made of tuberoses and roses. During the ceremony, he is required to make an outfit change- he is to change into fine silk two piece attire known as the ‘Jor’ before he meets the bride. The groom carries a round brass object with long handle known as the ‘Darpan’ at all times.
- **The attire of the Bengali bride** is one of the most regal and elegant wedding outfits. She usually wears a Red Benarasi Saree made of silk, that is heavily embroidered with gold zari threads. It may be draped in different ways, but the ‘aath poure’ style is traditionally what is seen during Bengali weddings. She wears a veil to cover her head and is adorned with a lot of jewellery. The quintessential Bengali artistic tendencies are displayed through the unique designs drawn on the bride’s forehead with kumkum and sandalwood paste, around the big red bindi. She also has to wear headgear that compliments the groom’s topor, known as Mukut. The Bengali bride has to carry an ornate wooden container filled with sindoor and a one rupee coin known as the ‘Gachh Kouto’.

## Tips for Guests:

- **Dress Code**: Wear bright and festive colors. Traditional Indian attire is appreciated but not mandatory.
- **Participation**: Feel free to participate in the dances and songs, it's a celebration!
